# âœ… DoIt - Task Manager

**DoIt** is a modern Android **To-Do list app** built using **Kotlin** and the **MVVM architecture**. It focuses on efficient offline task management with features like deadlines, categorization, and task filtering. The app was developed as a personal learning project to master **Room**, **ViewModel**, **coroutines**, and architecture components in Android.

---

## Features

- Add, edit, and delete tasks with full details
- Set task deadlines with **date and time pickers**
- Search tasks by title or description
- Filter tasks into **In Progress**, **Completed**, and **Missed** using tabs
- Navigation via **TabLayout** and Bottom Navigation
- Beautiful splash screen using **Lottie** animation
- Smooth task management with a clean UI and responsive design

---

## Concepts Applied

- **Room Database** setup with **DAO**, **Entities**, **Repository**
- **TypeConverters** for custom models and `DateTime`
- **Singleton pattern** for database provider
- **MVVM architecture** (ViewModel + Repository + DAO)
- **LiveData** for observing changes
- **Coroutines** for background database operations
- RecyclerView Adapter with efficient updates
- **ViewModel Factory** (first-time usage)
- Custom Toasts using `StyleableToast`
- Splash screen with **Lottie** animations

## Project Purpose

This app was created as a **personal training and portfolio project** with a strong emphasis on:

- Local storage with Room
- Coroutine-based async operations
- Working with ViewModel Factory and Repository
- Tab-based and bottom navigation patterns
- Structuring apps using MVVM architecture
- Building reliable and beautiful UI/UX experiences

> ðŸ“š *It was also my first hands-on experience with Kotlin Coroutines and ViewModelFactory.*
